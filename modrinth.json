  "description": "Server-side Fabric mod that smooths respawn anchor explosions by queuing them and executing a small number per tick. This reduces sudden TPS drops during mass anchor detonations while keeping vanilla behavior intact. The per-tick budget adapts to player count. A server-side opt-out is available via config, and an optional server-requested client opt-out can be enabled.",
